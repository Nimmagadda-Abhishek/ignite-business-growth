## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Guide (Hostinger/Node.js VPS)

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm installed on your server (Hostinger VPS or Node.js plan)
- MySQL database (credentials ready)
- Your domain (optional, for CORS)

---

### 2. Backend Setup

1. **Clone/Upload the project to your server**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install --production
   cd backend && npm install --production
   ```
3. **Create a `.env` file in `/backend` (see `.env.example`):**
   ```env
   DB_HOST=your-db-host
   DB_USER=your-db-user
   DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
   DB_NAME=your-db-name
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key
   PORT=3001
   ```
4. **Ensure the `/uploads` directory exists and is writable:**
   ```sh
   mkdir -p uploads/resumes
   chmod -R 755 uploads
   ```
5. **Start the backend:**
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm start
   # or
   node app.js
   ```
6. **(Optional) Set up a process manager (PM2, systemd) for production reliability.**

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. **Build the frontend for production:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```
2. **Deploy the `dist/` folder:**
   - For static hosting: Upload `dist/` to your Hostinger static site.
   - For Node.js hosting: Serve `dist/` with a static server (e.g., serve, Nginx, or Express static).

3. **API URLs:**
   - In production, set your API base URL to your backend server (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com/api`).
   - Update fetch calls if needed.

---

### 4. Database Setup
- Import your schema and data to the production MySQL database.
- Ensure all required tables exist (see `/backend` SQL examples).

---

### 5. File Uploads
- Uploaded files (resumes, etc.) are stored in `/uploads/resumes/` on your server.
- The backend serves `/uploads` as static files for download.
- Make sure this directory is not publicly listed (use proper permissions).

---

### 6. CORS & Security
- Set CORS in your backend to allow your frontend domain.
- Use strong JWT secrets and secure your `.env` file.
- (Optional) Use helmet, rate limiting, etc. for extra security.

---

### 7. Troubleshooting
- Check backend logs for errors (`npm start` output).
- Ensure all environment variables are set.
- Make sure the database is accessible from your server.
- For file upload issues, check permissions on `/uploads`.

---

### 8. Useful Commands
- **Install dependencies:** `npm install --production`
- **Build frontend:** `npm run build`
- **Start backend:** `npm start` or `node backend/app.js`

---

**For any issues, check logs and ensure all environment variables and permissions are correct.**
